# BertTransformer
This GitHub project demonstrates a basic Question Answering (QA) bot using the Transformers library. With a pre-trained BERT model, the bot answers questions based on a provided context. The code showcases a straightforward implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and serves as a foundation for building more advanced NLP applications.
