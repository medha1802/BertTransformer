# BertTransformer
This GitHub project demonstrates a basic Question Answering (QA) bot using the Transformers library. With a pre-trained BERT model, the bot answers questions based on a provided context. The code showcases a straightforward implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and serves as a foundation for building more advanced NLP applications.
# Question Answering Bot with Transformers

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Question Answering (QA) bot using the Transformers library. The bot is built using the BERT model and is capable of answering questions based on a given context.

## Features

- Utilizes the powerful BERT model for question answering.
- Supports customizable context and questions for testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Question Answering Bot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone insert_repository_url_here`
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install transformers`
3. Open and run the Colab notebook `Question_Answering_Bot.ipynb`.

## Usage

1. Open the Colab notebook and ensure it is connected to a Python runtime environment.
2. Modify the `context` and `questions` variables to input your own context and questions.
3. Run the cells to see the model's question answering in action.
